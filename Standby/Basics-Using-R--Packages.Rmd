Working with R Pacakges
====================================

\begin{itemize}
\item Type `library()` onto the command line to find out what packages were installed on your computer
when you put in `R`. 
\item Now type `search()` to get a list of the packages from that list that are
already loaded in (installed packages are not necessarily loaded in). 
\end{itemize}

Installing R Pacakges
