\frametitle{Vectors and assignment}

R operates on named data structures. The simplest such structure is the numeric vector, which is a single entity consisting of an ordered collection of numbers. To set up a vector
named x, say, consisting of five numbers, namely 10.4, 5.6, 3.1, 6.4 and 21.7, use the R command

\begin{framed}
\begin{verbatim}
> x <- c(10.4, 5.6, 3.1, 6.4, 21.7)
\end{verbatim}
\end{framed}

This is an assignment statement using the function c()

\end{frame} 
 
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Vectors and assignment} 
x=c(x,16)

adding a value
deleting a value
x=x[-9]
length()
\end{frame}
