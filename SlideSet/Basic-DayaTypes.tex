"summary" is a generic function used to produce result summaries of the results of various model fitting functions. 
The function invokes particular methods which depend on the class of the first argument. 
\begin{itemize}
  \item  attach()
  \item  data()
   \item  Loads specified data sets, or list the available data sets. 
  \item  ?
  \item  data.entry
  \item  c()

vectors

vector produces a vector of the given length and mode.
as.vector, a generic, attempts to coerce its argument into a vector of mode mode (the default is to coerce to whichever mode is most convenient).
is.vector returns TRUE if x is a vector of the specified mode having no attributes other than names. It returns FALSE otherwise.
