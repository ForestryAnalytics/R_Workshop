\frametitle{Relational and Logical Operators}

Relational operators allow for the comparison of values in vectors.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
  \hline
greater than &	$>$\\
less than&	$<$\\
equal to	&$==$\\
less than or equal to&	$<=$\\
greater than or equal to&	$>=$\\
not equal to	&$!=$\\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
 	\end{frame}
 	\begin{frame}

Note the difference of the equality operator "==" with assignment operator "=".

\& and \&\& indicate logical AND and $\|$ and $\|\|$ indicate logical OR.

The shorter form performs element-wise comparisons in much the same way as arithmetic operators. The longer form is appropriate for programming control-flow and typically preferred in "if" clauses.

\begin{itemize}
\item We can use relational operators to subset vectors (as well as more complex data objects such as data frames, which we will meet later).
\item We specify the  relational condition in square brackets.
\item We can construct compound relational conditions too, using logical operators
\end{itemize}
