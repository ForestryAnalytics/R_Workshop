 - History of R

Simple R Programming
 - Important R functions
  - help()
  - summary()
		"summary" is a generic function used to produce result summaries of the results of various model fitting functions. 
		The function invokes particular methods which depend on the class of the first argument. 
  - attach()
  - data()
  	- Loads specified data sets, or list the available data sets. 
  - ?
  - data.entry
  - c()
		- Combine Values into a Vector or List
  - assignment operator
  - Sys.time and Sys.Date returns the system's idea of the current date with and without time. 
  - q()


mode() - storage mode of a data object( data structure)

The expression as(object, value) is the way to coerce an object to a particular class. 

 - vectors

vector produces a vector of the given length and mode.
as.vector, a generic, attempts to coerce its argument into a vector of mode mode (the default is to coerce to whichever mode is most convenient).
is.vector returns TRUE if x is a vector of the specified mode having no attributes other than names. It returns FALSE otherwise.  


 	- integer
	Creates or tests for objects of type "integer".
		integer(length = 0)
		as.integer(x, ...)
		is.integer(x)
 	- Character
	Create or test for objects of type "character".
		character(length = 0)
		as.character(x, ...)
		is.character(x)
	-logical
	Create or test for objects of type "logical", and the basic logical constants.
		logical(length = 0)
		as.logical(x, ...)
		is.logical(x)
	-numeric
	Creates or coerces objects of type "numeric". 
		numeric(length = 0)
		as.numeric(x, ...)
		is.numeric(x)




 - Mathemathical functions
  	- operators "+","-","/","*","^"
	- sin(), abs(), cos(), exp, log(), log()
	- complex numbers

    * abs, sign, sqrt, floor, ceiling, trunc, round, signif
    * exp, log, expm1, log1p, cos, sin, tan, acos, asin, atan, cosh, sinh, tanh, acosh, asinh, atanh
    * lgamma, gamma, digamma, trigamma
    * cumsum, cumprod, cummax, cummin 

Special mathematical functions related to the beta and gamma functions.
Usage

beta(a, b)
lbeta(a, b)

psigamma(x, deriv = 0)

 - simple statistical functions
 	- measures of centrality
		-mean(),median()
	- measures of variability
		-sd(), mad(), IQR()
		-range() returns a vector containing the minimum and maximum of all the given arguments. 
		-IQR() computes interquartile range of the x values.
        - quantiles

 -var, cov and cor compute the variance of x and the covariance or correlation of x and y if these are vectors. If x and y are matrices then the covariances (or correlations) between the columns of x and the columns of y are computed.
 -cov2cor scales a covariance matrix into the corresponding correlation matrix efficiently. 

Pearson's Chi-squared Test for Count Data
chisq.test performs chi-squared contingency table tests and goodness-of-fit tests.

 - discrete: Binomial / Poisson / geometric distribution


Inference procedures
 - t.test
	Performs one and two sample t-tests on vectors of data. 
 - prop.test
        prop.test can be used for testing the null that the proportions (probabilities of success) in several groups are the same, or that they equal certain given values.
 - Kolmogorov-Smirnov test      [ks.test()]
	Performs one or two sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. 
 - Anderson Darling test        [ad.test()]

Logical functions and coercion
 - as.vector
 - is.na
 - NA is a logical constant of length 1 which contains a missing value indicator.
 - Missing value/ not available. 


Regression models and bivariate data
 - simple linear regression 
 - multiple linear regression 
 - lm()
 - lm is used to fit linear models. It can be used to carry out regression, single stratum analysis of variance and analysis of covariance

Anscombe's quartet is the name for a famous data set created by Frank Anscombe to illustrate the importance of plotting data.

The mean for al four data sets is 9.00,3.32, 7.5,2.03
